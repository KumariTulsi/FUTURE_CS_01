# OWASP Juice Shop Security Assessment  

This project presents a **web application vulnerability assessment** of **OWASP Juice Shop**, an intentionally insecure platform designed for security training and testing.  
The assessment was conducted during a **cybersecurity internship** to gain hands-on experience in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating common web application vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Key Findings
- **Replay & Impersonation** – Duplicate submissions and impersonated feedback  
- **SQL Injection** – Authentication flaw granting admin access  
- **User Enumeration & Info Leakage** – Error messages revealing valid accounts and sensitive details  
- **Insecure Token Design** – Weakly hashed credentials in tokens  
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** – Accessing other users’ data via identifier manipulation  
- **Business Logic Exploitation** – Abuse of refund process to manipulate credits
